        <h1 class="main_head">What is Space Exploration?</h1>
        <p>
          Space exploration is the physical investigation of outer space by uncrewed robotic space probes and through
          human spaceflight.

          While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the
          development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical
          space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific
          research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and
          developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[2]

          The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" in which the Soviet Union and the United
          States vied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the
          first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon
          landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first
          milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin
          aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing
          on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.

          In the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and
          from competition to cooperation, the foremost example being the International Space Station (ISS), built
          between 1998 and 2011.

          The 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs of China, the European Union, Japan,
          and India. The 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private
          launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. In the 2020s, the two primary global programs
          gaining traction are Moon-focused: the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the U.S.-led
          Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp, each with a set of
          international partners.
